Here you set up your generaldisplay and camera preferences.

Chipset: Set the target Chipset as ECS or AGA

Colors: Sets the maximum colors to be used, 64 in ECS (extra halfbright mode) 
and 256 in AGA.

Width: Thinner displays can speed up the game and may be also needed to use 
some REDPILL graphic effects.

Default Overwrite color: Allows to replace the selected color of the palette 
for another one. This one could also be a copper generated gradient. This 
color setup can be done level by level in the level properties screen.

Camera Follow: tells the camera to follow a game object.

Camera Foward focus: is used to set the camera in front of the object in 
pixels to see more level where it is facing.

Camera Smoothing: tells how smooth is going to be the camera movement, the 
higher the more smooth.

Force NTSC height: tells the display to have a height of 200 pixels even if
it is running in a PAL machine.

Fetch mode: In AGA machines, higher Fetch modes speed up some operation done
by the Amiga chipset. Gains performance specially in machines without FAST
RAM. Quadruple Speed can be used for screens with width 320, 288 and 256.
When using 320 and quadruple speed Sprite layer is likely to fail, you
will need to reduce the screen width.
