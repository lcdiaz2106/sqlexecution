In this screen Tilesets (or tile banks) are loaded and tile properties 
are assigned.

Once an image is loaded, tile size can be assigned for each tileset.
You can Edit it, if an editor has been assigned in tooltip of the Redpill 
icon.

You can assign a value to Border in case the image has empty space between
 the tiles.

Each Tileset can have its own palette too. Also each Level will have a
Tileset assigned to it defined in the Level Screen.

Image to Tiles can be used to load a source image, then REDPILL will find
the unique tiles in this image and generate a new tileset. Additionally,
the map itself can be replicated with this tileset in the current level map.

In Tile properties:
-Solidity defines if the tile is solid, objects with map collisions cannot
move through them. Platform solidity allow the objects to jump into the tiles.

-Shape tells the game if the tile is a square or a ramp.

-Layer is unused for now

-Animation can be used for animation tiles, you set up the number of tiles 
for the animation. The tiles must be consecutive.

-Anim speed sets up the speed for the animated tiles, the faster is set the
more performance will eat up from the computer.
