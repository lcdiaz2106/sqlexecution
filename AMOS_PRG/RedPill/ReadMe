-=REDPILL=- Amiga Game Creator
==============================
Beta v0.9.41
==============================

What it is
----------
-A tool to empower people to create many games for Amiga without programming knowledge.
-Easy to use and at the same time allow to do complex things.
-More a toy to play with than a professional tool, not having thousands of features but instead have few features that work very well.
-Allows people to create 2D games with the true Amiga feeling!
-It is  free.
-It is still in development.

What it isn't
-------------
-A tool aimed to create professional games, you will need to learn programming for that purpose.
-No need to be a programmer, but if you are one, then Asm, C, Blitz, Amos, etc. are more powerful than RedPill. Use RedPill if you are not good at programming, you want to develop fast or you want to have some fun :)
-It should not be suitable to create any type of game, but users are surprising me every day.
-It is not going to grow until it becomes Unreal, Unity, GameMaker or Skynet, it is still a hobbie project. 2021 update: it already has grow quite a lot.
-The priority is allowing Amiga users to create games, power and performance come second. I will start serious optimitzations from 0.9 onwards.

Features
--------
-Amiga integrated development environment, NO need for PC/Windows.
-Support for ECS and AGA.
-Copper management for gradients and extra colors.
-Parallax scrolling.
-Integrated sound generator.
-Sound effects playing at the same time as music without reserving an audio channel.
-Keyboard, Joystick and Mouse support
-CD32 support: Gamepad, CD music and load/save scores into nvram.
-2 players support.
-Integrated and seamless TCP/IP Network play between 2 players, play over the internet.
-Supports text using OS 8x8 fonts and any size custom fonts.
-Supports input buffer and coyote time.
-Integrated compression support.
-It can generate a package to be used in WHDLoad
-Transparency effects
-Multilanguage support
-Supports location based sound that makes sound effects sound softer the farther away they are from the listener.
-And many more not listed here :)

Requirements for the Games
--------------------------
-680x0 Processor
-1.0MB of total RAM (Chip+Fast)
-For big projects, more resources may be needed.
-Amiga native screen (PAL or NTSC)

Requirements for the Editor
---------------------------
-680x0 Processor
-1MB of Chip RAM
-6MB of total RAM (Chip+Fast)
-HardDrive or big storage
-For big projects, more resources may be needed.
-Amiga native screen (PAL or NTSC)

Running Editor from CLI
-----------------------
-Editor uses stack memory, if you have problems slicing big sprites please run the command Stack 64000 before starting RedpillEditor.

Editor Icon tooltypes
---------------------
-Check the tooltypes to be able to run your favourite paint and text programs.

Vampire specific
----------------
-In case you are using a Vampire V4SA you will need Release 3 or higher.
-AmigaOS and ApolloOS are supported.

Uses these 3rd party programs&resources
---------------------------------------
-DataToIff V1.1 - Sound File Conventer - Written by Janne Saarme 1990-1992.
-Shrinkler by Blueberry.
-Uses GuideML from Richard Koerber and Chris Young to generate html files from the AmigaGuide ones.
-Uses Phx Protracker player routine by Frank Wille and adapted to Blitz by Olivier Laviale
-Uses Phx Protracker lib by Frank While and adapted to Blitz by Iggy Drougge.
-Shotemup project uses graphics from Ansimuz in the OpenGameArt.Org (Warped Space Shooter). Music by Fireboy.
-PNG2ILBM PNG to ILBM converter by TCH.
-Ex_fx projects uses graphics from Ansimuz, Jetrel, Jordi Palome and me.
-Includes the bitmap font from the demo Ray Of Hope 2 by Majic 12, I think Rack is the author.

Beta notes
-----------
-RedPill is not super stable yet, use it with caution.
-We need your help to complete RedPill development, please send us bugs and suggestions.
-Default way to Exit a game pressing the ESC key
-In RedPill player editor use F1 to turn on/off the rendering of the collision boxes.
-RedPill uses standard Amiga IFF/ILBM files.
-WARNING! I will try to avoid that, but future versions of RedPill may change the project structure making the projects you develop not loadable.

Upgrading from older Redpill versions
-------------------------------------
When upgrading program, it is very recommended to make a backup of your projects, then open them with the new RedPill editor and save them.
Redpil Editor is programmed to upgrade your projects automatically, but if many versions have passed without upgrading a massive upgrade could cause some problems.
After a succesful upgrade save the project to avoid chances of having troubles in future releases.

Help
----
In the Triggers page, after selecting a trigger press help or the (?) button to get extra information about the Trigger.

Preparing a game for distribution
---------------------------------
-Open your game and then click on Build.
-A folder named build will be created inside your project folder.
-Build folder is your game folder to distribute.
-The distributable final <game>.redpill file cannot be reopen in the editor.
-There is support to start the game from a disk boot.
-There is support to create a WHDLoad file with the game.

Making a multiplayer Online game
--------------------------------
-Your Amiga compatible device needs to be online using a TCP stack. (for UAE users - just check "bsdsocket.library" in Expansions)
-First you can do your game as a local two player game.
-Now use the trigger Net Connect to start the online game.
-Use condition trigger Is Net Remote True to start the game if connection was succesful.
-Additionally use condition trigger Is Net Remote False to check if the connection has been terminated.
-You can use Pong project as a reference.

Playing games on The A500 Mini
------------------------------
You can use the Build option in the editor to generate a WHDload package that can be used in The A500 Mini.
Only in the first versions of the firmware, you need to edit your file THEA500\whdboot\game-data\whdload_db.xml and add the game at the end of file.
You will need to change the filename, name and sha1. To calcula the sha1 of your file you can use a tool like HashMyFiles in Windows or SHA-1SUM.lha in Amiga.
I guess in the future there will be an easier way to do it.

Example: You will need to change filename, name and sha1

<game filename="LumberjackPlatform" sha1="c82d1746be3b1c37bf8a8839bbdad62cf5018423">
		<name>LumberjackPlatform</name>
		<slave_count>1</slave_count>
		<slave_default>Game.slave</slave_default>
		<slave_libraries>False</slave_libraries>
		<slave number="1">
			<filename>Game.slave</filename>
			<datapath>data</datapath>
		</slave>
		<hardware>
		PRIMARY_CONTROL=JOYSTICK
		PORT0=JOY
		PORT1=JOY
		FAST_COPPER=FALSE
		JIT=FALSE
		SCREEN_AUTOHEIGHT=TRUE
		SCREEN_CENTERH=SMART
		SCREEN_CENTERV=SMART
		CHIPSET=AGA
		BLITTER=IMMEDIATE
		CLOCK=MAX
		FAST_RAM=0
		Z3_RAM=16
		</hardware>
</game>
