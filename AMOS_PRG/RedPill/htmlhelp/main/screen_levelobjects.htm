In this screen you Edit the different levels of your game.
-Objects tab: Place, move, delete objets in your level.
-Edit tab: Edit the level using tiles.

Use cursor keys to move around the map, if you press shift while moving
the speed will be much faster.

Objects Tab
-----------
In this tab the Objects of the game can be placed one or multiple times (if 
they are not static) in the levels.

The static objects are already in the level by default.

Level: to change the current level.
Level Properties: to go to the Level Properties screen.
Reload Level: Discards the changes and reloads the level.
Level Object: The current object selected in the level
Enabled: For static objects you can decide if you want it active or not for
 this level.
x, y: the position of the current level object.
Snap to tile: activate it to align coordinates to the tile grip positions.
Show Tile cols: to see the tile grid.
Add Level Object: to add non static objects to the level.

Edit tab
--------
Here the shape of the level is edited using the loaded tiles in the Tiles 
screen. Use the left mouse button to paint the level using the selected
tile. Use the right button to erase the tiles from the level.

Using the space key you can switch between the tiles and the level.
Use the control key to move the quick tile select window.

Level: to change the current level.
Tile bank: to select the tileset to be used.
Move map: allows to move the whole map tiles one position.
Select tile: to switch to the tile select screen.
Fill: single for single tile, fill to flood file using the tile selected.
The F key will have the same effect, use the C key to clear.
Clear: clears the level
Camera limit: used to define the level limits, the camera will move only in
this area.
Calculate: calculates the camera limits, based on the used area of the level.
Load map: used to read the map to disk, only the tiles.

Import bin: can be used to read a map stored in bytes.
Export TMJ: to export the map in a format that can be used in Tiled, a pc 
program.
Import CSV: Used to import a map stored in comma separated values.

to set it as the start, as changing it later could erase some parts of the 
level.
