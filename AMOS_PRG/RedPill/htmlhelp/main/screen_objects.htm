Objects are the game entities, are the only ones than can interact and 
change the game properties while the game is running.

They are placed in the level in certain coordinates, static objects being
in all levels by default.

Static objects are objects that exist only once, and they remain intact after
a level change.
In the Level Editor you can decide which static objects are active in each
level.
Non static objects can have multiple copies (instances) and are deleted after
a level change. Each of these non static objects can be placed multiple times
in the Level Editor or using Instantiate triggers.

Object: Changes the current object being editted.

Name: The name you will be using to refer to this object.

Type: Object cathegory, some object types have special properties.
-Player: for the object/s being used by the player.
-Shot: these objects take the direction of the object that instantiates them. 
       They are also destroyed when impacting.
-Enemy: used when the property Enemies collides enemies is activated
-Tile: TBD


Icon is a frame from the Sprite Sheets you can use to identify your object in
the Level Editor.

Each object contains triggers that execute the logic of the object.
A trigger has one or multiple conditions and when all conditions are meet,
all trigger actions are executed sequentially.

Z parameter can be used to sort the rendering of the objects.

Advanced tab
------------
-Update Object: For now this is unused.
-Max Speed: Allows to limit the maximum speed an object can move, for example 
to limit the maximum speed an object can fall.
-FX: Indicates this object will be rendered in the FX layer, rendering will
be much faster and will use the FX settings.
-FX Comp: Indicated this object render will erase the FX layer.

Objects present in the level are always active unless you use Awake on screen
and Sleep off screen. Using this flags can help speeding up your game as 
slept object processing will take less time.

-Awake on Screen: The object starts being processed when it is on screen.
-Sleep on Sceeen: The object stops being processed when it is not in the 
screen.
