Here you define animations based on the frames generated from sprite sheets.

Current Anim: the current animation being edited.

Current Frame: the current frame from the animation. Use keys 1 and 2 to 
quickly go to previous and next frames. Use space to play the animation.

Start Frame: sets the first frame of the animation.

Num Frames: sets the number of consecutive frames the animation has.

Frame time: sets for how long each frame will be visible before stepping 
to the next one. Smaller number means the animation will play faster.

Frame offset: Here you  can change the offset of each frame to make the 
frames visuals to match. You click and drag the current frame using the mouse. 
You can also use cursor keys to move the the frame.

Loop: Defines if the animation re-starts when it reaches the end.

Next anim: When the animation ends it will switch to the specified animation. 
Use -1 for no next animation.

Sound: You can specify a sound to play when the animation plays. Use -1 for 
no sound. 

Mirror anim: Use mirror anim to specify the mirror anim of the current one. 
This should be used for the animation looking right.
When in the object you use Play Anim &lt;anim facing right&gt; if the object is 
facing left the mirror animation (the one facing left) will be played instead.
This way when the Object changes the facing direction the animation will
change too. You can save some triggers using this.

Finally you can set the cross position that is used just as visual reference
